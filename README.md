# LostThreads
### Project: 
A server-side API app using the MVC paradigm, user authentication, and connected to a database. <br>

### Idea: 
A forum-based website catering to abandoned locations throughout Virginia. Users can register, create a profile with login credentials, search/browse/follow/create forum threads about abandoned sites. Each thread will allow users to upload pictures of the site(s) and give a description, location and the date it was visited.
